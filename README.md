# Overview

Note: this program requires tkinter.

Sometimes we have a bunch of files stacked together in one directory and it is time consuming to group these files.

With EasyFileMover, you can quickly select a type of file (.jpg, .pdf etc.) from a source directory and move them to a destination directory. Additionally, you may optionally filter the selected files by filename keyword.
